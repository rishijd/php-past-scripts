This folder demonstrates some model/mapper based code, where the bulk of the code lied as per MVC standard (models make up the brain of the system).

OOP concepts demonstrated. Mappers were used as a part of (previous) PHP Zend Framework documentation. APC database caching also used in some places.

Actual code has been modified and simplified in some cases so that non-disclosure information is not revealed. The system was in use for 11 years (i.e. the duration of our client relationship, and they then moved on to enterprise).
