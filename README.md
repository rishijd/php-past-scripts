# php-past-scripts
Demonstrates my coding style especially for model mappers and past ideas on building a custom, content managed multi-language e-commerce site.

Files in this folder are for a past client for whom we built a custom e-commerce multilanguage, multi-region web system. The system is no longer in operation (the client has moved to enterprise software). The code is not complete - I have only taken sample code (especially model mappers) to demonstrate my past PHP coding style. The site was maintained by myself and an engineering team who I hired and mentored. Scripts are also altered and simplified to make them generic where applicable (thereby not revealing any non-disclosure information).
